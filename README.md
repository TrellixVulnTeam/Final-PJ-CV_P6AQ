# Final-PJ-CV

## Final PJ for DATA130051 Computer Vision

This is a repo for final project of DATA130051 Computer Vision
### Task 1
Using an open source semantic segmentation model [DeepLabv3Plus-ResNet101](https://github.com/VainF/DeepLabV3Plus-Pytorch) trained on the Cityscapes dataset to perform semantic segmentation and visualize each frame of the video

### Task 2
The Faster R-CNN model is trained as follows: 
#### a) Randomly initialize and then use VOC for fine tune
#### b) Use backbone network pretrained on ImageNet, and then use VOC for fine tune
#### c) Use Mask R-CNN backbone network parameters trained on Coco to initialize Faster R-CNN backbone network, and then use VOC for fine tune
